This is a C# calculator project built using **Microsoft Visual Studio**. 
The project implements a fully functional calculator that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations and use advanced functions.

## Features

The calculator provides the following functionalities:

- **Numeric buttons (0-9):** Input digits to form numbers.
- **Mathematical operations (+, -, *, /):** Perform basic arithmetic operations.
- **Equals button (=):** Computes the result and displays it on the screen.
- **Backspace (←):** Deletes the last entered character.
- **Clear Entry (CE):** Clears the current input value.
- **Clear (C):** Resets the entire calculation.
- **Plus/Minus (+-):** Changes the sign of the current number.
- **Square Root (√):** Calculates the square root of the current number.
- **Percentage (%):** Calculates the percentage of the current value.
- **Inverse (1/x):** Calculates the reciprocal of the current number.

## Requirements

- **Microsoft Visual Studio** (any version supporting C# development)
- **.NET Framework** (ensure compatibility with the version used in the project)
